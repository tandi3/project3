# Akan Name Generator

## Project Description

The Akan Name Generator is a web application designed to take a user's birthday and gender, calculate the day of the week they were born, and output their Akan name. Akan names are derived from Ghanaian culture, where children are traditionally named based on the day of the week they were born and their gender.

This project demonstrates mastery of concepts such as data types, arrays, functions, control flow, and operators covered during the week.
